Interlude
=========

What is this?
-------------

This is a music rhythm game side-project created using the Slick2D game programming library. It's very similar to the music program known as Synthesia.

What to download?
-----------------

To try out this game in Windows, download the interlude_windows.jar and double-click it to play. Unfortunately, there is currently no support for this in a different OS.

Why is this not available for other operating systems?
------------------------------------------------------

I have no means of testing it and would prefer not to put up something that I can't even see myself.

Game Play
=========

I notice that are limited (and outdated!) instructions given in the game. Here are some better instructions/tips.

How do I play?
-------------------------

Click "Play", then click on a music. You will be brought to a scene where you can actually play the game content.

When playing, you will see notes streaming through the screen. To play a note, hit the key shown inside the corresponding circle on the same line as the note. Try to hit the key when the note is as close to the middle of the circle as possible. This will most accurately reflect how the music piece should be played.

What note am I playing?
-----------------------

After you chose your music, press the down arrow key. You'll see the note you are playing. Unfortunately it does not get more specific than that, you can't really tell the octave or the accidental (sharp? flat? natural?)

Scrolling through music
-----------------------

When you first click "Play", you'll see a list of music to play. And what's that arrow down there? Yes, it's pointing to the fact that there is more music to choose from. You can scroll down (and correspondingly up) by pressing the down array or scrolling down with your mouse/mousepad.

Activating autoplay
-------------------

After you choose your music (and if there are multiple instruments, after you choose the instrument), you'll be on the scene with note markers on the bottom. Tap the left-shift to activate autoplay. (Tap again to de-activate).

Changing the orientation
------------------------

So initially the notes will go from left to right. You can change that by rotating the screen by pressing the left and right arrows.

Changing the volume
-------------------

Click on "Options" after choosing your music (and instrument). You can slide the vertically-oriented slider to change the volume. When it says "2x VOLUME", this is not truly twice as loud. In the sense of MIDI, the velocity is doubled, but kept at a maximum of 128.

Changing the speed of the notes
-------------------------------

Click on "Options" after choosing your music (and instrument). You can also slide the horizontally-oriented slider to change the speed. Unfortunately this slider is not adequately labeled. You can only change the speed to 0.25x, 0.5x, 0.75x, ..., 2x. The slider will move to the speed you have dragged it closest to. You probably can't see which one you're on, but you can probably figure out from the fact that the slider is linearly-scaled.

Changing the play-style
-----------------------

More often than not you'll be playing with two hands, but there are two modes in the game: one-hand and two-hands. On the main menu, you can click on "Options" and select the mode you would like.

Changing controls
-----------------

Click on "Controls" in the main menu. You'll see each note letter correspond to a control. Click on the note letter and then press the key you want to use instead.

There is also this fairly unnoticeable feature that I think it pretty cool. You can change the order of the note letters. Look at the bottom of the controls page and you'll find the letters A through G. You can actually drag those around to change the ordering when you play.

What's my score?
----------------

Who cares, have fun.

Enjoy!
