Interlude
=========

Game Side-Project

If you're using Windows, you can see/play the game by downloading interlude_fat.jar and then double clicking it.

If you're using some other OS and would like to see/play the game, unfortunately you need to clone this repository and then run the main method in game/Interlude.java.


There are controls you can use in the game that are not stated in the instructions. You might want to rotate the orientation of the screen by using the left or right arrows during the game. You might also want to be in autoplay mode by pressing the left-shift key.
