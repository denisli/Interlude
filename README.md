Interlude
=========

This is a music rhythm game side-project created using the Slick2D game programming library. It's very similar to the music program known as Synthesia.

To try out this game in Windows, download the interlude_windows.jar and double-click it to play. Unfortunately, there is currently no support for this in a different OS.

Game Play
=========

As it is right now, there is no scoring system, but the points don't really matter. Just enjoy the music.

When playing, you will see notes streaming through the screen. To play a note, hit the key shown inside the corresponding circle on the same line as the note. Try to hit the key when the note is as close to the middle of the circle as possible. This will most accurately reflect how the music piece should be played.

Use the left and right arrows to change the orientation of the screen.

Tap the left shift key to toggle between autoplay mode and not.

Enjoy!
