Interlude
=========

This is a music rhythm game side-project. The interface and update logic were done using the Slick2D library. This project is currently (and probably forever will be) in development phase. More improvements/changes to the project will happen occasionally.

The current jar files are for an old version of the game, which are still playable (at least the Windows one is, not sure about the Linux one). The code is usually most up-to-date. You can pull the code, compile, and run it to play the most up-to-date game. Main method is in src/game/Interlude.java.
